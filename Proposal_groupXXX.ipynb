    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "In this project, we attempt to classify galaxies into categories based on their visual features. To achieve this, we will use images of galaxies from Galaxy Zoo, along with crowd-sourced labels that identify the type of galaxy within a given image. We will perform dimensionality reduction on the images in order to effectively retain features and build a model that utilizes those features (e.g. shape and color) to cluster the galaxies into distinct categories. Success will be measured by how accurately our model can identify the type of galaxy in a given image. We will compare the results of our model to the crowd-sourced labels for the images. \n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxies have a couple of different visual features, including shape, color, luminosity, and concentration. There are a few different ways that galaxies are classified, but the system we will be sticking to will use their morphology. There are 3 main categories of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we aim to solve is classifying galaxies based on visual features from images of them. For this, we will be analyzing each of the images and use unsupervised learning techniques to categorize them into groups of similar galaxy types. This problem can be measured in the following two ways. We can either choose to use the crowd-sourced labels in our dataset or we can calculate some score between galaxies that are grouped as a similarity metric.\n"

    "Label Data: https://data.galaxyzoo.org/#section-7\n",
    "\n",
    "These two datasets combined have 239,695 galaxy images and labels, with each image having 6 variables of interest - the x and y position of each pixel, the RGB values of each pixel, and the true label. The x, y, and RGB values make up the image, while the label describes the galaxy’s type and shape. The label data was gathered by a vote from a collection of volunteers who used the GalaxyZoo website to help classify the galaxies. The label data also contains a fair amount of other variables that we will not need, like the location of the galaxy and the raw voting results from the GalaxyZoo campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "One observation consists of a grainy color image of a target galaxy centered in a 424x424 pixel image. This image can also contain other, smaller galaxies which could prove to be a difficult issue to overcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "The critical variables from this dataset would be the x and y values of each pixel, as being able to extract the features from each galaxy and classify what type and shape from each galaxy is. The RGB values of each image may also prove to be important, as different galaxies tend to have different colors in this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the label data would have to be cleaned to only include the critical 6 variables we are interested in. Additionally, depending on the computing resources at hand, we may have to scale down the images to make sure that calculations are completed within a reasonable time. We may also have to normalize the RGB values of each pixel.\n"

    "\n",
    "The principal problem we aim to tackle for this project is the classification of galaxies through features in their images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The morphology of galaxy types in images involves variance in several properties, such as color, luminosity, and distribution of pixels. This type of variance can be captured in an initial application of dimensionality reduction. Once a large amount of variance can be explained in a handful of dimensions, algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering can be used to predict what morphology a galaxy belongs to.\n"

    "The Galaxy Zoo project, from which our data is obtained, has crowd-sourced labels for each galaxy. Each label is derived from a contribution of around 100,000 volunteers, reducing biases and ultimately providing a robust, confident classification<a name=\"lintott\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lintottnote). We can measure the efficacy of our model by looking at the accuracy of our model, as well as its associated error rates. Because of the low-stakes nature of our project, it isn’t necessary to consider how “wrong” a prediction is. A rather simple formula of (number of correct predictions) / (number of predictions) will be sufficient to see how well the model does.\n"

    "However, there is an ethical concern regarding misinformation. The labels for the images in our dataset are crowdsourced, which has potential for bias. The volunteers that contribute to the labels come from various backgrounds with different levels of experience, so different people might label certain images differently. As a result, there is a risk that the data might not be entirely accurate. In turn, the results of our model may not be accurate either. Therefore, people who view our project should keep in mind that our model might not classify each image correctly and should consider using other sources to verify information that is presented. \n"
