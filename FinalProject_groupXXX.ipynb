    "# Abstract \n",
    "In this project, we investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning algorithms on clustering different galaxy shapes using images. To achieve this, we used a dataset containing images of galaxies and various algorithms such as K-means, GMM, Spectral, and DBSCAN to cluster galaxies that had similar shapes. We also ran evaluation metrics such as silhouette score and Adjusted Rand index to assess the performance of the resulting clusters and their corresponding algorithms. Overall, we saw low silhouette and Adjusted Rand scores from each algorithm’s cluster, leading us to believe that unsupervised algorithms are not suitable for this task. However, we believe that the conclusions of our project have been influenced by limitations such as computational load and data complexity, so this problem could be investigated further with more resources.

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxies are fascinating astronomical objects that are extremely numerous and diverse - it’s estimated that there are billions or even possibly trillions of galaxies in the observable universe, each with unique properties/features. They vary in size from being ultra massive to relatively small, with a multitude of shapes such as elliptical (appears as a concentrated elliptic blob), spiral (has a circular twist and arms), and irregular (sparse and not as structured). Some are young and actively growing whereas others are ancient and dormant. As mentioned in our proposed solution, color and luminosity can vary as well. Luminosity can be affected by its age, metallicity, component stars, dust content, distance from the observer, etc. On the other hand, color not only can be affected by composition, but also by redshift; as the universe expands at an accelerated rate, the objects that are farther from us recede faster, which creates a phenomenon called redshift in which the light’s wavelength is stretched (since the universe itself is expanding) and appears redder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diversity galaxies offer makes them excellent subjects for image classification and exploratory study. Due to this, in recent years, the field of galaxy classification through machine learning not only has seen advancements, but has also greatly helped researchers study these astronomical bodies. Galaxy Zoo is a project that provided visual morphological classification, which refers to categorizing galaxies based on their shape and structure (e.g. spiral, elliptical, irregular), based on galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)<a name=\"lintottnote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lintott). The first Galaxy Zoo paper’s aim was to \n",
    "distinguish between the two morphological classes pertaining to massive systems, namely spirals and early-type systems<a name=\"lintottnote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#lintott). \n",
    "\n",
    "Galaxy Zoo 2<a name=\"zoo2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#zoo2), which is the data we are using, is a succeeding project that considers more detailed morphological features such as \"galactic bars, spiral arm and pitch angle, bulges, edge-on galaxies, relative ellipticities, and many others\"<a name=\"zoosite\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#zoosite). Moreover, galactic bars refer to the elongated structures composed of stars and interstellar matter that extend from the center of spiral galaxies; pitch angle measures the tightness of spiral arms around a galaxy’s center; bulges are the tightly packed collections of stars at the centers of galaxies; edge-on means observed from the side, which would make the bulge more visible; and relative ellipticity is the galaxy’s deviation from a circular shape.\n",

There are 3 main categories of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular. \n",

From there, a normalized set of vectors representing the grayscale, centered image (1 x 2500) can be run through dimensionality reduction methods, such as UMAP and PCA. Once a large amount of variance can be explained in a lower amount of dimensions, our projected data will enter various clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, Spectral, and GMMs. We will then evaluate the performance of each clustering algorithm’s results to answer our problem."

Since our dataset also contains correct labels, we can use the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to score our clusters.

    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the Result \n",
    "\n",
    "While progressing through this project, we began to uncover how complex classifying images in the GalaxyZoo 2 dataset was. After PCAs and KPCAs were run on the image data, each clustering technique we tried uncovered more and more facets of the dataset that each strategy struggled with. Although we were not able to come up with a conclusive process for clustering or classifying these images, with each technique we tried, we were able to get a deeper understanding of what makes this dataset difficult and what future techniques that can be employed to classify the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by looking at the processed images, and realized how subtle the difference between the images were for galaxies of different categories for humans, let alone for an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "![similar_galaxy_examples.png](report_images/similar_galaxy_examples.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>From left to right: an ellipitcal (E) galaxy, a spiral (S) galaxy, and a spiral barred (SB) galaxy.</i></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to some concerns as to how well these small defining characteristics would be represented in a dimensionality reduction, as we would not have the time nor computing power to process the entire 2,500 variables for each image. We also found that most of the images in this dataset had non-target galaxies present in the same frame as our target galaxy. This combined with the subtlety of the features that differentiate the galaxies from each other lead to a difficult situation where both the noise and signal comes from variance between different samples. Despite this, we hoped that with a lot of images, the variance from the irrelevant galaxies would not have too much impact on the classification. We attempted to use UMAP to project the high-dimensional data down to a 2-D visualization, which resulted in a very cluttered graph with no obvious clusterings. We took this result as evidence to continue the rest of our analysis using high dimensional techniques.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To run our analysis in higher dimensions with the time and computing power we had at our disposal, we ran a PCA on our flattened images and isolated the principal components that explained the most amount of variance between images. This resulted in the first 35 principal components being identified as the components with the most variance. To see if we could separate the data in a way that could be clustered and visualized in a 2-D, we ran K-means, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN using the first 2 principal components identified by our PCA to see if any of them would work. Similarly to the UMAP graph, this also resulted in a series of cluttered graphs without any obvious clusterings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing as the data was still too cluttered in a 2-D space even after identifying the components with the most variance, we used GMM and spectral clustering and calculated the adjusted Rand index for each to see if clustering in higher dimensions would be effective. The adjusted Rand index for the GMM for all covariance types were close to zero, suggesting that the data were still too similar to be separated, even with 35 principal components. Spectral clustering also yielded a similar outcome, with near zero adjusted Rand indexes for all parameters passed through. This also suggests the data is too dense to be separated. The failure of both clusterings suggests that even in higher dimensions, the data provided was very similar, and thus were very dense in high dimensional space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall failure of PCA suggested that the data was not linearly separable, so we moved onto KPCA to see if the data was non-linearly separable. The first 66 components were chosen from a variance threshold of 90%, and then GMM and DBSCAN were then run on these components. Both GMM and DBSCAN had poor adjusted Rand indexes across both a radial KPCA and a polynomial KPCA. There is the possibility that a more complex kernel could result in better separation of the data, but we neither had the computing power nor the time to explore this further. This suggests that the data we were trying to analyze was also unable to be separated non-linearly, which means that the images may just be very similar even in the original 2,500 dimensional space. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation regarding the data was the amount of images per galaxy shape. The “E” and “S” shapes had around 95,000 corresponding images each, but the “SB” shape had around 45,000 images and the “A” shape only had 544 images. The uneven distribution of images affected the algorithms we used, as it was more difficult to cluster and represent the shapes with less data and similarly, could have introduced bias towards the shapes with more representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a larger scale, one of the major limitations for our project was computational load. The dataset that we used consisted of more than 230,000 424x424 images and their labels, so if we did not reduce the features in our data, it would have taken excessive time and computational load to run our algorithms. As a result we performed dimensionality reduction in order to reduce the computational costs. However, by reducing the dimensions of our data with PCA, we were working with images that had potentially lost relevant information regarding their shapes. Ideally, we would be able to run our algorithms on the data with all of their original features for more accurate clustering performance, but this was not possible given the computational constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another larger limitation for our project was time. We noticed that a fair amount of our data contained noise due to extraneous planets and stars in the background of the images, but we did not have time to investigate how and to what extent the noise affected our PCA results. The noise in our data could have added variance that was not related to the structure of the galaxy shapes, which in turn could have affected the calculation of the principal components and the models using the resulting PCA data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that we used contains images and labels that are provided publicly by Galaxy Zoo. Since this data is public and does not pertain to any individuals, it does not present any privacy concerns. Similarly, the aim of our project does not pose any privacy concerns, as our focus was to classify galaxy types using this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is an ethical concern regarding misinformation. The labels for the images in our dataset are crowdsourced, which has potential for bias. The volunteers that contribute to the labels come from various backgrounds with different levels of experience, so different people might label certain images differently. As a result, there is a risk that the data might not be entirely accurate. In turn, the results of our model may not be accurate either. Therefore, people who view our project should keep in mind that our model might not classify each image correctly and should consider using other sources to verify information that is presented. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "From the various unsupervised learning techniques we attempted to use throughout the course of our project, we learned more and more about the complexity of the data that we were working with. The unique combination of subtle defining characteristics for galaxy shape and the inconsistent appearance of irrelevant galaxies in the target frame led to this dataset being particularly difficult to classify with the methods we learned. Because of how similar the data is, even in high dimensions, it is difficult to separate the data using both linear or non-linear processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these results from this report and seeing that researchers are exploring using neural networks to automatically classify galaxies, a promising avenue to investigate would be using supervised machine learning algorithms to try and classify the galaxy images. Given that all of the images are labeled in this dataset and that algorithms like neural networks are able to pick up on subtle patterns that differentiate between categories, applying a neural network could potentially yield better results than the ones found in this report.
